# CUDA Matrix Multiplication: Understanding Grid and Thread Allocation

## Introduction

When first learning CUDA's memory allocation and parallel execution, it can be a bit difficult to grasp. Since our goal is to accelerate computation, we need to ensure that **each thread in the grid handles only one element of matrices A and B**.

I'll use the two images below for explanation

In this context, `N` represents the length of one side of matrix `A`. Suppose we have:

- `A.dim = (16, 16)`, meaning `A` is a **16x16 matrix**.
- Therefore, `N = 16`.

Now, let's assume:

- `blockDim = (4, 4)` (each block contains 4Ã—4 = 16 threads).
- `gridDim = (4, 4)` (the entire grid contains 4Ã—4 = 16 blocks).
- `B.dim = (16, 16)`, meaning `B` is also a **16x16 matrix**.

### Computing Global Indices

Each thread computes a unique element in `C` using its global index:

```cpp
int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
```

For an element in `C[row, col]`, the thread performs matrix multiplication:

```cpp
if (row < N && col < N) {
    float value = 0.0;
    for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
        value += A[row * N + k] * B[k * N + col];
    }
    C[row * N + col] = value;
}
```

- The **maximum row index** is `15` (`N-1`).
- The **maximum column index** is also `15`.
- The loop variable `k` runs from `0` to `15` (i.e., `k < N`).
- The element access `A[row * N + k]` corresponds to `A[15 * 16 + 15]`, which is `A[255]`, the last element in the matrix. The same logic applies to `B`.

### Example: Calculating an Element in `C`

Let's analyze how CUDA computes a specific element, say `` in the right-side diagram.

- `C(1,2)` is located at ``, meaning:

  - `blockIdx.y = 1`
  - `blockIdx.x = 2`

- Using the formula for **global indices**:

  ```cpp
  row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  ```

- Assuming `threadIdx = (0, 0)`, we get:

  ```cpp
  row = 1 * 4 + 0 = 4;
  col = 2 * 4 + 0 = 8;
  ```

Thus, **the thread at **``** and **``** is responsible for computing **``.

## Key Takeaways

1. Each **thread** calculates a single element in `C`.
2. `N` is the dimension of square matrices `A` and `B`.
3. Global indices `(row, col)` are determined by `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`.
4. The calculation process ensures **each thread accesses the correct element of A and B** to compute `C[row, col]`.

This structured approach ensures **efficient and parallelized matrix multiplication on CUDA**. ðŸš€
